  % JAW: Set up job name quoting before latex.ltx
  % Web2c pdfTeX/XeTeX quote job names containing spaces, but LuaTeX does
  % not do this at the engine level. The behaviour can be changed using
  % a callback. Originally this code was loaded via lualatexquotejobname.tex
  % but that required a hack around latex.ltx: the behaviour has been altered
  % to allow the callback route to be used directly.
