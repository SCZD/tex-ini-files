# Model TeX format creation files

This bundle provides a collection of model `.ini` files for
creating TeX formats. These files are commonly used to inroduced
distribution-dependent variations in formats. They are also used
to allow existing format source files to be used with newer
engines, for example to adapt the plain e-TeX source file to
work with XeTeX and LuaTeX.
